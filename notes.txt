Questions:

- times are usually in seconds since the epoch, but someimtes they are in ISO 6801. Example: electric power usage summary updated and published. WTF.


- a few strategies...

- meter readings / up and down the tree /


-Usage Point: (mostly a meter, but it could be a submeter or whatever)
	 - has meter readings (container provides link between the intervals and the type... each meter reading as a reading type..., helps describe the value)
	 	- has one reading type: tells you what the units of measure are, what the scale is, what kind of measure.
	 	- has intervalBlocks (they have time, duration...)
	 		-has intervals (have start time, duration, value, ~somtimes cost)
	- electric power usage summary (0 or many)
	  - arbitrary number for a given usage point
	  - start time, duration, billing period, summary from last period, for current billing period
	- local time parameters (one)



- you would instantiate an object for each "entry", figure out what type it was, and based on that you could deserialize it based on what you knew that object type might contain.

- when you find a usage point, you would
	- collect its references
	- see if any of them had already been found
	- 

- identify an anomaly - look for a spike / or a drop in power
- if you have baseline usage, you could tell if you are better or worse than others

- key learning points:
	- excersise that we just went through, 
	- learning how the entries are associated with each other.
	- link / strategy.
